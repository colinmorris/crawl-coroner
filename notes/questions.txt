Some questions I'd like to be able to answer with the data. (These are helpful in deciding what fields to prioritize adding to the parser)

> prefix -> this is implementable with currently parsed data
>> implemented in notebook

are low-winrate players more likely to use automatic skill point distribution?

stealth investment, newbs vs. pros

how often do characters (esp. DDs) worship Makhleb JUST for the healing? i.e. 
    no investment in invocations, no/few casts of destruction/summoning abilities
    (I totally did this on my first DD char)

where do players get stuck?
    looking at players with a lot of games played and 0/few wins, is there a pattern 
    to where they're topping out? e.g. they keep dying in the lair, or vaults 5, or 
    getting their first rune, or whatever.

where do good/great players die?
    is vaults 5 disproportionately more deadly for newbs than expert players?

> gold earned/spent (scatterplot).
    hypothesis: more skilled players are more liberal about spending their gold.

skill distribution, differences among players of different skill levels
    hypotheses...
        skilled players put more points in defensive skills
        skilled players are more likely to diversify 
        unskilled players are more likely to max a weapon skill early

    tackle this with regression? predict level of skill X given {plvl, bg,
    species(?), player_winrate}. Or predicted player_winrate given {plvl, bg,
    species, skill_level_X}. Are these exactly equivalent? (Maybe also add
    {won?, nrunes} as predictors? Cause there might be a lot of variance around
    XL 27, because of end-game shenanigans. Ideally would just combine these
    into total XP earned, but that number isn't available to use.
        The first version of this is maybe a tiny bit more tricky, cause would
        want to account for the fact that skill must be in range [0,27]. Need 
        to use some kind of generalized linear model?
TODO: it'd be really useful to parse skill progression, rather than
just skill levels at time of death/winning. Could use the table
or just parse level ups from notes.


consumable usage
    at what rate do players die while having blink scrolls, tele scrolls, heal wounds, etc.
        in their inventory?
    do skilled players identify their consumables earlier in the game?

enchanting weapons/armour
    are more skilled players more liberal with their enchant scrolls? i.e. is it
    a newbie trap to hold on to enchant scrolls waiting for that perfect item to
    use them on, only to die before finding it?

is trying to kill everything you come across a newbie trap? i.e. are more skilled players
more likely to put an exclusion on a tough monster and return to it later?

per-player questions...
    how many players are monomaniacs wrt the species/bgs they play? 
        what species/bgs do players devote themselves to?
        any specific funny example?
    dist of games played per player
    scatter #games vs. #wins (or hexbin)
    counts of players according to certain criteria wrt experience/skill, e.g.
        - 0 wins, at least n games
          - most games played without a win?
        - >0 wins
        - >0 15-rune wins
        - >n games, >x% win rate

'amateur-friendly' species/bgs/gods
    which choices correspond to the highest win rates among players who can win the game, but just barely?
    i.e. players with a low #wins/win%.

most popular species/bgs/gods for first wins?
    (with caveat that we don't know if they have a previous win locally, or on another server/username)

branch order!

> shields. who uses em? who trains em?

Is it worth it to do Elven Halls?

> Temple diving. How often do (good) players do it? How does it work out for them?

Ranking demonspawn mutations.

What do (good) players tend to use acquirement on?
    Looks like this information might not actually be recorded in morgue files. :(

What do (good) players tend to buy from shops?

>>scatter plot of #turns against wall clock time

>How popular is each species/bg combo?
>How winning is each species/bg combo?
    how to visualize this is an interesting problem (especially if we want to 
    show popularity and winrate simultaneously)
    maybe a heatmap?
        if you wanted simultaneous visualization, you could maybe have a circle/square
        at each (species, bg) cell, whose size is proportional to (log) pick rate
        and whose colour reflects win rate.

> How is your success rate affected by which S-branches you get?

>>Differential success rates for different colours of draconians!
    interesting to verify that colours are distributed uniformly
    also, lol, interesting to see suicides per colour. Indication of which colours people scum to get, and which they think are hopeless.
    >>draconians get a colour at lvl 7. Is there a spike in deaths at that level?
% version

>>Distribution of deaths across player levels.
    Equivalently(?) what % of games are won given that at least level X is attained?

>>dist of deaths by level & branch

>How popular/winning is each god? (Maybe only count godless for winningness)
    P(win|god), P(god|win)
    Need to be careful about late game abandonment+conversion, and zealots.

> Which gods do people worship opportunistically? i.e. if they see an overflow altar
to this god at D:2, they might worship there even though they didn't set out to 
do so.

How often do (good) players worship at random altars? How does it affect their win rate?

>> How often is each skill non-zero among winning chars?
> Dist of skill levels among winners, foreach skill.
    You could finally do a KDE!

>> How often is each skill maxed out?

How popular is each spell among winning chars?
    P(spell|win), P(win|spell)

>> How often is each rune taken among 3-runer wins?

>> Dist. of #runes across wins.

Top killer monsters (already done).
[A little tricky]: Top *solo* killers. i.e. where under the map in the morguefile it just says 'You could see X' 

Most cast spells. Most used when memorized ('most spammed').

Most cast spells among winners.

Most unused spells (lowest avg. # casts | spell is memorized)

Which spells do players most often memorize given opportunity (this'd be interesting, but v. hard to calculate)

How much permafood eaten | win? How much permafood left in inventory?

What % of winners drink a potion of mutation or eat mutagenic flesh?

[hard] What do players tend to do when they're about to lose? e.g. drink pots, read scrolls, cast spells
[hard] what log events are predictive of losing? falling down a shaft, getting paralyzed, etc.

What @statuses are associated with death? e.g. about to teleport, corroded, repel missiles...

>What killers and locations are associated with deaths of characters having 1, 2, 3 runes?

>> How deadly is each portal level (sewer, wizlab, volcano, etc.). Given that I enter a portal of type X, what's the probability that I die there?

Does which floor the temple spawns on affect your chance of winning?
